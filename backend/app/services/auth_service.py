"""Authentication business logic for signup and login.

The HTTP route handlers in api/routes/auth.py are thin wrappers around the
two functions defined here. Keeping the business logic separate from the
transport layer means the SQL + password-verification flow can be unit-
tested without spinning up FastAPI, and the route handler stays a one-liner
that just forwards form fields to the service.

Closed vulnerabilities relevant to this file:
- VULN-1 (SQL Injection): every SQL statement uses parameterized `?`
  placeholders. Never reintroduce string concatenation here.
- VULN-5 (Weak Password Storage): passwords are hashed with bcrypt via
  core/security.hash_password() before insert, and checked with
  core/security.verify_password() in Python (NOT inside SQL -- bcrypt's
  per-call salt makes SQL equality matching impossible).
