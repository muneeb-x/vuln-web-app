"""Transactional email senders for the Email-Verification and Email-OTP-2FA
features.

Stdlib only -- ``urllib`` + ``json`` for the SendGrid HTTP-API transport -- so
the features add no new dependency, mirroring the stdlib-only posture of
``core/csrf.py`` and ``core/rate_limit.py``. All settings come from
``core/config.py`` (env / git-ignored ``.env``); no secret is hardcoded here
(VULN-4 posture).

Single transport: the **SendGrid HTTPS API**. Some hosts (e.g. Render's free
plan) block outbound SMTP ports, so an ``smtplib`` path cannot connect there;
SendGrid's ``/v3/mail/send`` endpoint is reached over HTTPS (port 443, not
blocked) via stdlib ``urllib``. The API key is sent in the ``Authorization``
header and is NEVER logged. (The earlier SMTP/Gmail transport has been removed --
SendGrid is the only sender.)

Public surface: ``send_verification_email`` (signup link) and ``send_otp_email``
(login one-time code). Both are deliberately FAIL-SAFE -- they return ``False``
(never raise) when email is unconfigured or any send/API error occurs, logging
the cause server-side. A failed send must never crash a request handler nor
change auth state: the caller treats ``False`` as "couldn't send" and the user
can resend.

Security note: the HTML alternative part splices the username and the
verification URL with ``html.escape(..., quote=True)`` before they enter the
markup (VULN-2 posture -- output encoding), so a username containing HTML
cannot inject into the email body. The raw OTP code is NEVER logged (VULN-3).
