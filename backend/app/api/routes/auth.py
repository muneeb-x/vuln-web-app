"""HTTP route handlers.

All eight endpoints of the lab app live here. The handlers are
deliberately thin: they parse request inputs, call into the service layer
(`auth_service`) or directly query the DB for read-only routes, render or
escape any HTML, and return a Response. No business logic, no SQL string
construction, and no password hashing happens in this module.

Route summary:
- GET  /         redirect to /signup (default landing page)
- GET  /signup   render signup form (issues CSRF token)
- POST /signup   create account, redirect to /login
- GET  /login    render login form (issues CSRF token)
- POST /login    authenticate, write session, return JSON
- GET  /search   case-insensitive search across users (intentionally public)
- GET  /welcome  protected dashboard (requires session)
- GET  /logout   clear session, redirect to /login

Closed vulnerabilities relevant to this file:
- VULN-1 (SQL Injection): `/search` uses parameterized `LIKE ?`.
- VULN-2 (Stored XSS): `/welcome` escapes the username before splicing
  into the dashboard template.
- VULN-3 (Reflected XSS): `/search` escapes q, every row column, and the
  exception text before splicing into the response HTML.
- VULN-6 (Exposed Database): the pre-fix `/download/db` route is gone.
- VULN-8 (CSRF): GET /signup and GET /login splice a per-session token
  into a hidden form field; the CSRFMiddleware validates it on POST.
