"""SQLite connection and schema initialization.

This lab uses a single SQLite file (`vulnerable_app.db` at the repo root) as
its only datastore. The file is auto-created on first launch by init_db(),
which runs once from main.py at startup.

Why SQLite and not Postgres/MySQL? The app is an educational lab meant to be
clonable and runnable with zero infrastructure. SQLite ships with Python,
needs no server, and lets students reset the data layer with a single `rm`.

import os

# Absolute path to the database file: <repo>/vulnerable_app.db.
# The four `..` segments climb from this file (backend/app/db/session.py)
# back up to the project root. We resolve this at import time so the path
# is stable regardless of which directory uvicorn was launched from.

      connection per request and never sharing it).

def init_db():
    """Create -- or upgrade -- the users table.

    Called once from main.py at app startup. Idempotent and row-preserving:
    a fresh DB gets the full schema below; a pre-existing DB (e.g. from
    v1.0.2, before Continue-with-Google) is migrated IN PLACE by adding any
    of the four OAuth columns that are missing. No row is ever dropped.

    Schema notes:
    - `username TEXT UNIQUE`: signup relies on this to surface
      "Username already exists" via sqlite3.IntegrityError.
    - `password TEXT` (NULLABLE): local accounts store the bcrypt hash
      string; Google (OAuth-only) accounts store NULL -- there is no weak
      hash to leak, and the unchanged password login() fails closed on a
      NULL hash, so such accounts simply cannot log in with a password.
    - `google_id TEXT UNIQUE`: the user's stable Google subject id, or NULL
      for local accounts. SQLite allows multiple NULLs under UNIQUE, so
      local users coexist freely.
    - `name` / `picture`: the Google profile display name and avatar URL
      (stored, not rendered in this release).
    - `auth_provider TEXT DEFAULT 'local'`: 'local' or 'google'.
    - `is_verified INTEGER DEFAULT 0`: 0 = email not yet confirmed, 1 = verified.
      Google (OAuth) accounts are created as 1; existing rows that predate the
      Email-Verification feature are grandfathered to 1 by the migration below.
    - `verification_token TEXT`: the active single-use email-verification token
      (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`), or NULL when none is outstanding.
    - `verification_token_expires REAL`: Unix epoch seconds after which the
      token is dead, or NULL. Compared against `time.time()` on /verify.
    - `failed_login_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0`: consecutive failed credential
      checks since the last success / lock (Account-Lockout feature, v1.0.5).
      Reset to 0 on any correct password.
    - `locked_until REAL`: Unix epoch seconds until which the account is locked
      out after too many consecutive failures, or NULL when not locked.
      Compared against `time.time()` on every login / resend.
    - `two_factor_enabled INTEGER DEFAULT 0`: 1 when the user opted into Email
      OTP 2FA (Email-OTP-2FA feature, v1.0.6); a correct password then issues an
      emailed code instead of completing login immediately. Defaults to 0 (off),
      so existing rows are unaffected without a grandfather UPDATE.
    - `otp_code TEXT`: the current outstanding 6-digit login OTP (raw), or NULL
      when no challenge is pending. Single-use: cleared on a successful verify.
    - `otp_expires REAL`: Unix epoch seconds after which the OTP is dead, or NULL.
      Compared against `time.time()` on /login/otp.
    - `otp_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0`: wrong-OTP submissions against the current
      code; reset to 0 on each new code, and the code is invalidated when this
      reaches OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS.
    - `otp_last_sent REAL`: Unix epoch seconds of the most recent OTP send, used
      to enforce the per-account resend cooldown, or NULL.
    - `totp_secret TEXT`: the base32 authenticator-app TOTP shared secret
      (MFA-via-Authenticator-App feature, v1.0.7). Set as *pending* when
      enrollment starts, persists while enrolled, NULL when the user has none.
    - `totp_enabled INTEGER DEFAULT 0`: 1 only after a confirm code validated the
      secret; 0 while disabled or while a secret is pending (generated but not yet
      confirmed). Defaults to 0, so existing rows need no grandfather UPDATE.
    - `totp_last_step INTEGER`: the last accepted TOTP time-step counter, for
      replay protection (a code already used cannot be reused inside its window);
      NULL until the first successful verify.
