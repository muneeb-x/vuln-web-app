# Security Vulnerability Lab

An intentionally vulnerable web application designed to teach common security vulnerabilities through hands-on exploitation. Rather than studying vulnerabilities in theory, you'll exploit them in a working application to understand how real attacks work.

Built with FastAPI and SQLite — simple enough to read in one sitting, realistic enough to demonstrate actual attack techniques.

**Live Demo:** https://vuln-web-app.onrender.com

> **WARNING:** This application is deliberately insecure. It is designed for educational use only and should never be deployed to production or used on systems you do not own.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arifpucit/vuln-web-app.git
cd vuln-web-app

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Running the Application

From the project root:
```bash
uv run backend/app/main.py
```

The app starts at **http://localhost:3001**. The database file (`vulnerable_app.db`) is created automatically on first run.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|:---:|
| GET | `/` | Redirect to signup | No |
| GET | `/signup` | Display signup form | No |
| POST | `/signup` | Create user account | No |
| GET | `/login` | Display login form | No |
| POST | `/login` | Authenticate user (returns JSON) | No |
| GET | `/welcome` | Protected dashboard | Yes |
| GET | `/logout` | Terminate session | No |

## Intentional Vulnerabilities

| # | Vulnerability | OWASP Category | Location |
|---|---------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | SQL Injection | A03:2021 - Injection | `auth_service.py` — string concatenation in queries |
| 2 | Stored XSS | A03:2021 - Injection | `auth.py` — unescaped username on dashboard |
| 3 | Reflected XSS | A03:2021 - Injection | `auth.py` — unescaped query param in search |
| 4 | Session Hijacking | A07:2021 - Auth Failures | `main.py` — hardcoded secret key |
| 5 | Weak Password Storage | A02:2021 - Crypto Failures | `security.py` — MD5 without salt |
| 6 | Exposed Database | A01:2021 - Access Control | `auth.py` — unauthenticated `/download/db` |
| 7 | No Rate Limiting | A07:2021 - Auth Failures | Global — no throttling middleware |
| 8 | CSRF | A01:2021 - Access Control | Global — no CSRF tokens on forms |

## Features

- User registration with client-side password confirmation
- User login via async fetch with inline error display
- Protected dashboard with personalized greeting
- Vulnerability discovery checklist with color-coded tags
- Responsive split-screen layout for auth pages
- University-branded header with organization logos
- SQLite database with automatic initialization
- Database auto-recreated if deleted (on restart)

## Learning Path

1. **Explore the app** — Sign up, log in, and navigate the dashboard to understand normal functionality.
2. **Read the source code** — Each vulnerability is commented in the code with its vulnerability number.
3. **Exploit each flaw** — Use the vulnerability table above to locate and exploit each one.
4. **Fix it** — Patch each vulnerability using secure coding practices: parameterized queries, output escaping, strong password hashing, rate limiting, and CSRF tokens.

## Useful Commands

Check the database contents:
```bash
sqlite3 vulnerable_app.db "SELECT * FROM users;"
```

Reset the database (delete and restart):
```bash
rm vulnerable_app.db
uv run backend/app/main.py
```

Free port 3001 if already in use:
```bash
# macOS / Linux
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3001 | Select-Object OwningProcess
Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**`uv command not found`**
Install uv: `pip install uv` or see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

**`Port 3001 already in use`**
Kill the existing process using the commands in "Useful Commands" above.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`**
Run the app from the project root with `uv run backend/app/main.py`. The entry point automatically adds `backend/` to `sys.path`.

**Database seems corrupted or stale**
Delete `vulnerable_app.db` from the project root and restart the app. The database is recreated automatically on startup.
